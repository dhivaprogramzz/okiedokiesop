Sat in the glossy Guggenheim gallery,
eyes on Kupka’s Dynamic Disks
I began to think of relationships as circles,
the blue/red/white/black spirals imperfect
and un-unioned, obscuring the broken run
of black lines, the way
they break
like eggs, waves, light bulbs, marriages.
Since our separation I have been spilling
ink on lined pages, wondering what stopped
working when the plates were put away and
how many times we asked with water in our eyes
what we wanted if it wasn’t art on the wall
in the house by the sea?
